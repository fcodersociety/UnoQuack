UNO-HID Library:

The library defines a series of functions that make sending HID codes intuitive. Rather than having to look up and send HID codes for every character, 
the library takes care of it for you. Here's the jist:

Each HID report is sent as a key plus a modifier. The modifiers are CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, and GUI. By default each key is sent with a modifier of zero. 
The modifiers can be masked together to send more complex commands. The function pressKey() is overloaded to do this. 

For example:

	To send the keypress 'k', use
		
		pressKey('k');
	
	To send the keypress CTRL+ALT+k, use

		pressKey((CTRL | ALT), 'k');


There are similar functions for "Special Keys" like F1 that do not appear in the ASCII table. 

For example:

	To send the keypress TAB, use
		
		pressSpecialKey(TAB);
	
	To send the keypress CTRL+ALT+TAB, use

		pressSpecialKey((CTRL | ALT), TAB);


There are also functions for printing ASCII strings, similar to the Serial.print() and println() functions. 
All of the functions are listed below:

	begin()
		
		Initializes the HIDKeyboard object by ending any Serial communication and resetting it to 9600 baud

	pressKey(modifier, key)
	pressKey(key)

	pressSpecialKey(modifier, key)
	pressSpecialKey(key)

	releaseKey()

		Releases any keys and modifiers that are currently down. 
		NOTE: the pressKey and pressSpecialKey functions DO NOT release the key. releaseKey must be used to release the key. 

	print()
	
		Sends keypresses for a full string. For example print("Hello World!");

	println()
		
		Sends keypresses for a full string, followed by a carriage return. 

EXAMPLE:
	
	#include <HIDKeyboard.h>
	HIDKeyboard Keyboard; 

	void setup() {
		Keyboard.begin(); // Initializes keyboard
	}	

	void loop() {
		Keyboard.println("Hello World!");	// Types "Hello World!" followed by a carriage return
		Keyboard.pressSpecialKey(ENTER); // Sends an "Enter" keypress
		Keyboard.releaseKey(); // Releases "Enter"
		Keyboard.pressKey('a'); // Types 'a'
		Keyboard.releaseKey(); // Releases the 'a' key
		Keyboard.pressKey(SHIFT, 'a'); // Types 'A'
		Keyboard.releaseKey(); // Releases 'a' and SHIFT
		while(1); // Hold forever
	}

OUTPUT:

	Hello World!

	aA
