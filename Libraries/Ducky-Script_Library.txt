Ducky Script is the language of the USB Rubber Ducky. Writing scripts for can be done from any common ascii text editor 
such as Notepad, vi, emacs, nano, gedit, kedit, TextEdit, etc.

SYNTAX:
Ducky Script syntax is simple. Each command resides on a new line and may have options follow.
Most commands invoke keystrokes, key-combos or strings of text, while some offer delays or pauses. 
Below is a list of commands and their function, followed by some example usage.

1. REM:- 
Similar to the REM command in Basic and other languages, lines beginning with REM will not be processed. REM is a comment.
	
	Ex:
		REM The is a comment

2. DEFAULT_DELAY OR DEFAULTDELAY:- 
It is used to define how long (in milliseconds * 10) to wait between each subsequent command. 
DEFAULT_DELAY must be issued at the beginning of the ducky script and is optional. Not specifying the DEFAULT_DELAY will result in faster execution of ducky scripts. 
This command is mostly useful when debugging. REM and DELAY are excluded.

	Ex:
		DEFAULT_DELAY 10 
		REM delays 100ms between each subsequent command sequence
		GUI r
		--- Delayed 100 ms ---
		REM 100ms have passed.
		DELAY 1000
		--- Delayed 1000 ms due to DELAY Function ---
		STRING notepad.exe
		--- Delayed 100 ms ---
		STRING hi there, this is cipherusprime
		--- Delayed 100 ms ---

3. DELAY:- 
Creates a momentary pause in the ducky script. It is quite handy for creating a moment of pause between sequential commands that may 
take the target computer some time to process. DELAY time is specified in milliseconds from 1 to 10000. Multiple DELAY commands can be used to create longer delays.

	Ex:
		DELAY 50
		REM will wait 500ms before continuing to the next command.

3. STRING:-
It processes the text following taking special care to auto-shift. STRING can accept a single or multiple characters.
Accepted chracters for STRING: | a…z A…Z 0…9 !…) `~+=_-“‘;:<,>.?[{]}/|!@#$%^&*()

	Ex:
		REM This Types below string "Hello World!"
		STRING Hello World!

4. WINDOWS OR GUI:-
Emulates the Windows-Key, sometimes referred to as the Super-key.

	Ex:
		GUI r
		REM will hold the Windows-key and press r, on windows systems resulting in the Run menu.
5. MENU OR APP:-
Emulates the App key, sometimes referred to as the menu key or context menu key. 
On Windows systems this is similar to the SHIFT F10 key combo, producing the menu similar to a right-click.

	Ex:
		REM The below script creates a new folder on Desktop.
		GUI d
		MENU
		STRING w
		STRING f
		ENTER
6. Modiferkeys:-
The modifiers can be masked together to send more complex commands.
Below are most modifiers.


	SHIFT
	ALT
	CONTROL OR CTRL
	Arrow Keys -> DOWNARROW or DOWN | | LEFTARROW or LEFT | | RIGHTARROW or RIGHT | | UPARROW or UP

7. Extended Commands:-
These extended keys are useful for various shortcuts and operating system specific functions and include.

	BREAK or PAUSE
	CAPSLOCK
	DELETE
	END
	ESC or ESCAPE
