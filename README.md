# Pre Requisites
- You need to add [UNO-HID Library](https://github.com/SFE-Chris/UNO-HIDKeyboard-Library) to Arduino's IDE (one time thing).
- After uploading the code to Arduino, Atmega16u2 needs to be flashed with [Arduino-keyboard-0.3.hex](https://github.com/coopermaa/USBKeyboard/tree/master/firmware) in order to work as HID device.
- And once the work is done, it needs to be flashed back with orginial [Ardunio-usbserial-uno.hex](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/firmwares/atmegaxxu2/arduino-usbserial/Arduino-usbserial-uno.hex) in order to upload any code agian.
- Intructions for flashing .hex frimware to Arduino can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/DFUProgramming8U2) on official page.  
  
 \[I'm Plannig to write a new frimware to avoid flashing every time\]
 
 # UnoQuack Insturctions
**UnoQuack** is an easy DuckyScript to Arduino Uno payload converter.   
  
## Web converter - online üåê (Recommended)
You can use UnoQuack by visiting the <a href="https://cipherusprime.github.io/UnoQuack/" target="_blank">converter website</a> .

## Python converter - Local üíª or üì±

You can download python file (unoquack.py) from [realeases](https://github.com/cipherusprime/UnoQuack/releases/download/v1.0/unoQuack.py).  
And use it locally.

> **USAGE:**   
- Run: ` python3 unoQuack.py ./duckyscript.txt optional_payload_name.ino`
- **./duckycript.txt** is location to input Ducky script.
- **optional_payload_name.ino** is the optional output file name (if left blank default name is "**Uno_Payload.ino**").
- converted Arduino Uno Payload will be in the same directory.
